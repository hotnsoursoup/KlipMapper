Stub screens were created during an earlier migration when Riverpod conversion was incomplete. These files are archived to remove them from routing and compilation:

- checkout_screen_stub.dart
- reports_screen_stub.dart
- services_screen_stub.dart
- settings_screen_stub.dart

Routes now point to the original feature screens to preserve the intended UI while providers are migrated incrementally.
