# NEW_BUILD — Session Checklist

Purpose: Track this session’s intent, scope, and gates per AGENTS.md.

## Session Meta
- Date: TBD

## Quick Start Checklist
- [x] Read `docs/OPTIMIZATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- [ ] Run core tests (`relationship_analysis_test`)
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Record results and issues below

## Notes
- AGENTS.md read (provided by user). Using project docs under `docs/`.
- TreeSitter pinned at 0.22.6 per constraints.

## Findings / Decisions
- No `REF.md` present; adding one to point to canonical docs.
- Proceeding with tests to confirm current status before any code change.

## Follow-ups (if any)
- Add performance baseline scripts after tests pass.
